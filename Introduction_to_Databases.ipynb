        "1. **Relational databases:** These databases store data in tables with rows and columns. They use a structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. Examples of relational databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **NoSQL databases:** These databases use a non-relational data model, which means they don't use tables, rows, and columns. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as document, key-value, and graph. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Object-oriented databases:** These databases are designed to work with object-oriented programming languages, such as Java and C++. They store data in objects, which are similar to the objects used in programming. Examples of object-oriented databases include db4o and ObjectDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hierarchical databases:** These databases organize data in a tree-like structure, with each record having one parent and possibly many children. They're often used for storing information about organizational structures or file systems. Examples of hierarchical databases include IBM's Information Management System (IMS) and the Windows Registry.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Network databases:** These databases are similar to hierarchical databases, but they allow each record to have multiple parents and children, forming a network of relationships. They're often used for modeling complex relationships between entities. Examples of network databases include Integrated Data Store (IDS) and CA-IDMS."

        "When using multiple constraints in SQL:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Choose the right constraint for the job:** There are several types of constraints available in SQL, such as primary key, unique, foreign key, and check constraints. Each has a specific purpose and should be used appropriately. For example, use a primary key constraint to ensure a unique identifier for a table, use a foreign key constraint to enforce referential integrity between tables, and use a check constraint to validate data based on a specific condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Keep constraints simple:** While it is possible to combine multiple constraints in SQL, it's important to keep them as simple as possible to ensure that they are easy to understand and maintain. This means avoiding overly complex constraints that are difficult to read or modify, and sticking to simple combinations of basic constraints, such as NOT NULL and UNIQUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Consider performance implications:** When using multiple constraints in SQL, it's important to consider the potential performance implications. Constraints can slow down queries and other operations, particularly when working with large datasets. It's important to test constraints thoroughly to ensure that they are not having a negative impact on performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Use appropriate indexing:** To help improve performance when using multiple constraints in SQL, it's important to use appropriate indexing. Indexes can help to speed up queries and other operations by allowing the database to quickly locate specific data. Consider creating indexes on columns that are frequently used in constraints to improve query performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Test thoroughly:** Finally, when using multiple constraints in SQL, it's important to test them thoroughly to ensure that they are working as intended. This means testing constraints in a variety of scenarios, such as inserting, updating, and deleting data, to ensure that they are enforcing data integrity correctly. Regular testing can help to identify issues and ensure that constraints remain effective and efficient over time.\n"
