        "1. **Relational databases:** These databases store data in tables with rows and columns. They use a structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. Examples of relational databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **NoSQL databases:** These databases use a non-relational data model, which means they don't use tables, rows, and columns. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as document, key-value, and graph. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Object-oriented databases:** These databases are designed to work with object-oriented programming languages, such as Java and C++. They store data in objects, which are similar to the objects used in programming. Examples of object-oriented databases include db4o and ObjectDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hierarchical databases:** These databases organize data in a tree-like structure, with each record having one parent and possibly many children. They're often used for storing information about organizational structures or file systems. Examples of hierarchical databases include IBM's Information Management System (IMS) and the Windows Registry.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Network databases:** These databases are similar to hierarchical databases, but they allow each record to have multiple parents and children, forming a network of relationships. They're often used for modeling complex relationships between entities. Examples of network databases include Integrated Data Store (IDS) and CA-IDMS."
