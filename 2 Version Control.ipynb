        "In version control, a repository is used to store all the files and their respective versions. It keeps track of every modification made to the files, allowing to view and compare different versions, revert to previous states, and track who made the changes and when. This is particularly useful when multiple people are collaborating on a project, as it helps to avoid conflicts and provides a way to merge changes made by different individuals.\n",

Version control systems provide mechanisms to resolve such conflicts by highlighting conflicting sections and enabling users to manually reconcile the differences.\n",

Git offers powerful branching and merging capabilities and has become the de facto standard for version control in many software development projects.\n",
