It keeps track of every modification made to the files, allowing to view and compare different versions, revert to previous states, and track who made the changes and when. This is particularly useful when multiple people are collaborating on a project, as it helps to avoid conflicts and provides a way to merge changes made by different individuals.\n",

        "> command > output_file 2> error_file\n",

        "> ```\n",
        "> This command searches for all the .txt files in the current directory and its subdirectories. The list of matching files is redirected to `files.txt`, while any error messages are redirected to `error_log.txt`.\n"
